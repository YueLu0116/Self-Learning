# Oracle Bones

- 时间跨度：This book was researched from 1999 to 2004, **a period whose events are still resonating**.
- Sitting by the window, there are moments when a numbness sets in, and the scenery seems **as patterned as wallpaper**: a peasant, a field, a road, a village; a peasant, a field, a road, a village.
- 中国封建王朝与罗马帝国的兴亡对比，此句和上一句相呼应，形成作者所见与所感（历史）的共鸣：In the traditional view of the Chinese past, there is no equivalent of the fall of Rome, no Renaissance, no Enlightenment. Instead, emperor succeeds emperor, and dynasty follows dynasty. History as wallpaper.
- 洛阳铲，中国考古的象征：The workers are local peasants, and they dig with Luoyang spades—the characteristic tool of Chinese archaeology.
- His cultural references are broad and sometimes they **catch me by surprise**.
- Hessler's sentence: Nanjing was the sort of place important events always seemed to march through on their way to some other destination.
- Hessler's sentence again: Over the centuries, various armies had occupied the city, and great leaders had come and gone, leaving nothing but tombs and silent memorials of stone.
- The one who jumped had just been **dumped by** his girlfriend. 
- 作者将游行队伍和上课时齐声朗诵的学生做对比：It reminded me of the Chinese students I had taught a year earlier—the way they memorized lessons by reciting **in unison** during study time before class. And these marchers also looked like my former students: mostly skinny men in glasses and button-down shirts.
- 信息舆论"I listen to the Voice of America and I know what’s happening there"：“They have a problem with their brains,” he said, after pouring each of us a second shot of baijiu. “The students are all so stupid—they don’t understand anything.” “Do you agree with what NATO is doing in Yugoslavia?” I asked. “Of course I agree with them. The Albanians are being killed because they’re an ethnic minority. I listen to the Voice of America and I know what’s happening there. And I think it’s important because I am a Uighur from Xinjiang. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
- Sitting in the Muslim restaurant, I was **taken aback by** the question.
- 一起宿醉吧：smiling at the memory of whatever shared demons had brought them together that night.
- 【历史】：In the 1920s, some Turkic residents began to push for independence, describing themselves as “Uighur”—a name that hadn’t been used for almost a millennium.
- 【历史】：While clipping in the bureau, I would at times come across a follow-up story. In July, George Tenet, the director of the CIA, testified before Congress. He acknowledged that, of the nine hundred sites targeted by NATO’s bombing campaign, only one had been researched and selected solely by the CIA: the Chinese embassy. Tenet emphasized that it had been mistaken because of the outdated map.
- 【词汇-相亲matchmaking】In one of his letters, he described how he had relied on matchmaking relatives to find a wife.
- 离开小镇的青年们：The ones who left tended to share certain characteristics: they were at the top academically, and they were outgoing and lively. They spoke good English. Their ideas were different—usually, their compositions had shined.
- Deng protected the nation in part by allowing his corner of Sichuan to remain poor and forgotten.
