# Url encoding

URL里不能包含哪些字符，或者说如果包含了会引起歧义，需要进行转义。

参考google map[文档](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/url-encoding?authuser=1#common-characters-that-need-encoding)

> In effect, this means that URLs must contain only **a special subset of ASCII characters**: the familiar alphanumeric symbols, and some reserved characters for use as control characters within URLs.
