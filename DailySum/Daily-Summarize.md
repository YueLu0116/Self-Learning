     > **The extended keys** consist of the ALT and CTRL keys on the right-hand side of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; the NUM LOCK key; the BREAK (CTRL+PAUSE) key; the PRINT SCRN key; and the divide (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. The extended-key flag is set if the key is an extended key.
     >
     > An application typically ignores **scan codes**. Instead, it uses the device-independent virtual-key codes to interpret keystroke messages.

  2. 【reference】[GetKeyState](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getkeystate)

     >
     > - If the high-order bit is 1, the key is down; otherwise, it is up.
     > - If the low-order bit is 1, the key is toggled. A key, such as the CAPS LOCK key, is toggled if it is turned on. The key is off and untoggled if the low-order bit is 0. A toggle key's indicator light (if any) on the keyboard will be on when the key is toggled, and off when the key is untoggled.

  1. 【reference】[finalizers](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors)

     > - Empty finalizers should not be used. When a class contains a finalizer, an entry is created in the `Finalize` queue. When the finalizer is called, the garbage collector is invoked to process the queue. An empty finalizer just causes a needless loss of performance.
     >
     > - In .NET Framework applications (but not in .NET Core applications), finalizers are also called when the program exits.
     > - C# does not require as much memory management on the part of the developer as languages that don't target a runtime with garbage collection. This is because the .NET garbage collector implicitly manages the allocation and release of memory for your objects. However, when your application encapsulates unmanaged resources, such as windows, files, and network connections, you should use finalizers to free those resources.
     > - To release the resource, implement a `Dispose` method from the [IDisposable](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/api/system.idisposable) interface that performs the necessary cleanup for the object. This can considerably improve the performance of the application. 

- git

  1. 【Q&A】[what is "fork a repo" in github?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

     > - propose changes to someone else's project:
     >   - Fork the repository.
     >   - Make the fix.
     >   - Submit a pull request to the project owner.
     > - Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

  1. [AI教父Hinton争夺秘史](https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404620023359733998&sudaref=keep.google.com)

     - 2012年，百度开始大规模采购和建立GPU运算集群，开发了世界上第一个支持GPU&CPU的并行深度学习平台。
     - 他们（学生）建议Hinton，与其接受百度的邀约成为这家公司的员工，不如三个人直接共同成立一家公司，然后去谈收购——不管是百度，还是其他公司，都显然更可能为后者投入更多的资金。

- CMake:

  1. 【Q&A】[What is the meaning of the keyword `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, and `INTERFACE` related to CMake's `target_include_directories`?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26243169/cmake-target-include-directories-meaning-of-scope)

  2. 【Q&A】[cmake：target_** 中的 PUBLIC，PRIVATE，INTERFACE](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/82244559)

     > - PRIVATE: 生成 libhello-world.so时，只在 hello_world.c 中包含了 hello.h，[libhello-world.so](http://libhello-world.so/) 对外的头文件——hello_world.h 中不包含 hello.h。而且 main.c 不会调用 hello.c 中的函数，或者说 main.c 不知道 hello.c 的存在
     > - INTERFACE：接口。生成 [libhello-world.so](http://libhello-world.so/) 时，只在[libhello-world.so](http://libhello-world.so/) 对外的头文件——hello_world.h 中包含 了 hello.h， hello_world.c 中不包含 hello.h，即 [libhello-world.so](http://libhello-world.so/) 不使用 [libhello.so](http://libhello.so/) 提供的功能，只使用 hello.h 中的某些信息，比如结构体。但是 main.c 需要使用 [libhello.so](http://libhello.so/) 中的功能。

  1. 【reference】[Miscellaneous Mouse Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/other-mouse-operations)

     > About mouse wheel:
     >
     > - If the user rotates the mouse wheel, the window with focus receives a WM_MOUSEWHEEL message. The wParam parameter of this message contains an integer value called the delta that measures how far the wheel was rotated. The delta uses arbitrary **units**, where 120 units is defined as the rotation needed to **perform one "action." **Of course, the definition of an action depends on your program. For example, if the mouse wheel is used to scroll text, each 120 units of rotation would scroll one line of text.
     > - If the mouse wheel has a high resolution, the absolute value of the delta might be less than 120. In that case, if it makes sense for the action to occur in smaller increments, you can do so. For example, text could scroll by increments of less than one line. Otherwise, accumulate the total delta until the wheel rotates enough to perform the action. Store the unused delta in a variable, and when 120 units accumulate (either positive or negative), perform the action.

  2. 【resource】[container](https://medium.com/geekculture/introduction-to-containers-basics-of-containerization-bb60503df931)

     > -  The operating system is the software that manages this hardware. OS consists of a system program known as the kernel, which is loaded in the memory when OS starts. The kernel is responsible for process management, CPU scheduling, file system & IO.
     > - The software consists of a component called **Hypervisor** or Virtual Machine Manager. Hypervisor runs on top of this host OS. Users can launch their individual OSs using the hypervisor. These OSs are known as **guest OSs**. The guest OS then manages the virtual hardware created by the Hypervisor.
     > - Virtual Machines are heavyweight & add to the system complexity. 
     > - LXC (Linux Container) was the first implementation of containerization technology. It leveraged the Linux **cgroups and namespace** isolation to create light-weight containers. In fact, the initial version of Docker was directly built on top of LXC.
     > - Containers don’t require the installation of a separate guest operating system. They directly **run and use the host operating system.** Containers only need the dependent file system and binaries for their functioning. 
     > - An **image** is a binary file or a dependency to run an application.
     > - Let’s assume that we want to run a python webserver. In this case, the python interpreter becomes its primary **dependency**. Further, the python interpreter has OS-specific dependencies. Hence, Images are built using a **layered approach**.
     > - The base OS layer doesn’t consist of the whole operating system and its kernel. It only contains the file system and dependent binaries. - light weight
     > - When a container is started, it pulls all the images from the repository. It then creates cgroups, namespaces, and the virtual environment. From a container’s perspective, the binaries & files appear to be the only files in the whole machine.

     > - on your nightstand 床头
     >
     > - Right now, I’m reading and enjoying a few different books at once: Dostoyevsky’s “The Karamazov Brothers,” in a translation by Ignat Avsey; Zadie Smith’s collection “Grand Union”; and Andrés Barba’s forthcoming novel “A Luminous Republic,” translated by Lisa Dillman.
     >
     > - I like to be alone and undisturbed, so I can read out loud to myself if I feel like it. If I get tangled up in a sentence or I lose my train of thought, I find reading aloud can be helpful. Alone on the sofa with a cup of coffee is pretty close to the ideal. As for what I’m reading, preferably something old, but it should also be something I’ve never read before.
     >
     > - How do you organize your books? I don’t. I just accumulate new ones all the time and leave them lying around on shelves and household surfaces in no order whatsoever.

  4. 【resource】[Standard SWE Level Framework](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/swe-level-framework.html)

     > - Software Engineers are expected to develop their skills in a variety of areas to be eligible for promotion and move to the next level. 
     >
     > - ambiguity, scope of work and impact
     >
     > - As an Entry Level Engineer, you’ll be expected to develop and maintain lower complexity components under the guidance and tutelage of more experienced team members. Although mostly working on group projects, the Entry Level Engineer is encouraged to demonstrate initiative to innovate and should perfect basic coding skills.
     >
     > - The Software Engineer demonstrates the ability to work on projects autonomously. They also develop and maintain low to moderately complex components, likely leaning more towards the moderately complex problems. Specialization in one or more coding languages is common.
