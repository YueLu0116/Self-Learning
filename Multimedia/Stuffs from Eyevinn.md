An over-the-top (OTT) media service is a media service offered directly to viewers via the Internet. 

### Three ways to protect OTT content

1. Tokens: .When a client request is received by a server, the incoming token is validated the originating request, i.e. preventing URL sharing, tampering or other changes. When a client player browses the video portal and selects a piece of content, it is being redirected to a content specific URL.
2. HTTPS
3. DRM-Digital Rights Management: DRM includes the distribution of encryption and decryption keys, backend licensing servers with various functionalities such as policy control and offline playback control.
